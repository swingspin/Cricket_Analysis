# Cricket_Analysis
This study is focused on building various predictive models for various predictions related to cricket, either be win probability or run prediction, a model is compared according to its prediction outcomes with Duckworth-Lewis (DL) method for each and every stage of a proceeding match, also study looks to explore the results of next T20WC in Australia,2022. All Studies describes system and algorithms and finally present quantitative results displayed by best suited algorithm having highest accuracy for the proposed models.
Important to read points:
1. The complete code is in a single file for each model respectively and runnable on python preferably google drive or jupiter notebook.

Code files:
Win Probability Model & Comaprison with DL method -2nd_Innings_Model and DL Method Comaparison.ipynb
Run prediction model - 1st innings predictions.ipynb
Deployment of web application - Win_model_deployment.py
World Cup predictor model - ICC_T20_World_Cup_2022_Model.ipynb

2. Data is present in different csv files as folllows:

detailed dataset for year 2019-2022-'del_csv.csv'
summary dataset for year 2019-2022-'Book1.csv'
detailed dataset for year 2016-2019-'1619_csv_01.csv'
summary dataset for year 2016-2019-'new_1619.csv'

3. Need to install Py-charm software for running the deployment model.

4. Pandas, numpy, sklearn, seaborn, streamlit (in PyCharm) and pickle are important packages that should be installed before working on the code.

5. Chucks of code is created to run the code in an order and functions are created for each step of work.

6. All models are simple and wont take more than 15 minutes together, PyCharm deployment model needs to be runned on the local host and can run within few minutes if all packages are pre-installed.
   - Kindly mind the processing power and have system connected to power to not loose the progress.
